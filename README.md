The Chewable Framework
======================

Chewable is designed to make your life easier for game development.

Inspired by XNA, it is a Go component-based framework that aims to serve as a solid foundation for getting a game up and running quicker.
The original framework was written in C++ and can be found here: http://chewable.googlecode.com/

Chewable is as minimal as a library can be and does not require any dependencies to compile.
It does NOT include features for windowing, input, graphics, audio but the framework's design allows these systems to be plugged in easily.
